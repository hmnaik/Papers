  abstract = {{This paper studies the invariant theory for its applications to computer
	vision. In the first part of the paper, three methods of invariant
	calculation are presented: 1. the infinitesimal method which gives
	a precise enumeration of the maximal number of independent invariants
	existing in a given problem; 2. the generalization and constraint
	method; 3. the use of canonical invariants associated with some transformations,
	which is, in our opinion, the method to be used primarily, for all
	problems where only simple elements (points, straight lines, conics)
	are involved. In the last part, invariants are applied to 3D vision
	problems: 3D invariant computation from multiple images in investigated
	in detail in the case of uncalibrated cameras. Experimental results
	are given on artificial data: this allows to study the robustness
	of invariants to increasing levels of noise. Some results are also
	given on real data to show that 3D invariants are usable in practice.}},
