CenterEstimationError : 

We have a circle in world and we rotate it from 0 to 80 along X axis, detect the position of circle and normal at each angle rotation. 
for distance of 500 to 2000 mm. 
i.e. say at 500mm and 45 degree original points it at ( A,B,C) 
Ground truth is = ( X,Y,Z ) 



Basically = 


NoiseVecotr = 1 to 100 ( Different vector with same mean )  
	Distance = 500 to 2000 mm 
		angle rot = 0 to 90 degree
			save( measurement )
		end
	end
end

So for each configuration we have 100 readings of center position. 
lets say P1,P2,P3,P4.... Pn. 
Lets say P is ideal value. 

Error is e1 = || P - P1 ||
For 100 Values we have = [ e1 e2 e3 e4 e5 ...... en ]

Std Div = swrt ( var) 
var = sum ( ( e1 - mean(e1 to en)^2 ) / n
