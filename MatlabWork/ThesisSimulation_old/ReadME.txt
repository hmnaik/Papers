* THis simulation results are based on 
Angle : 0 to 70 Degree
Dist : 500 to 2000 mm 
Noise : 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 
R : 5 , 12, 15
Iter : 100 

Std Div : This measurement is done with =  1/n(Xi - X(Mean_OF_Xi_over_N))^2
X can be mean of all but for known ground truth we should have X as real value. However these results are also good if mean is to be mean of the error.
